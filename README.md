This Program is my study on the course named Communications Network.

## Description 

This is the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) Simulate, if you don't know how it works take a look on Wikipedai Cyclic redundancy check. :)

CRC Sender need to encode the dataword into codeword.
CRC Receiver need to determine the received codeword if the received codeword been corrupted by noise, then discard it. Otherwise received the dataword.

The CRClib provided some features:

* Sender side:
    * Get random dataword function.
    * Generate augmented dataword function.
    * Generate remainder function.
    * Generate codeword function.

* Receiver side:
    * Generate syndrome function.
    * To decide whether discart received dataword or not.
    * Get dataword back from codeword function.

* Unreliable Channel:
    * Generate random noise by input error rate parameter.

It also provided input customized dataword by using getinput function.

## How To build the application

Because this project is the Xcode project, you need...

* Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or late version.

## NOTE
