# CRC Simulate

Copyright Â© 2009 Che Wei Lin. All Rights Reserved.

This Program is my study on the course named Communications Network.

## Description 

This is the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) Simulate, if you don't know how it works take a look on Wikipedai Cyclic redundancy check. :)

CRC Sender need to encode the dataword into codeword.
CRC Receiver need to determine the received codeword if the received codeword been corrupted by noise, then discard it. Otherwise received the dataword.

The CRClib provided some features:

* Sender side:
    * Get random dataword function.
    * Generate augmented dataword function.
    * Generate remainder function.
    * Generate codeword function.

* Receiver side:
    * Generate syndrome function.
    * To decide whether discart received dataword or not.
    * Get dataword back from codeword function.

* Unreliable Channel:
    * Generate random noise by input error rate parameter.

* logging:
    * logging CRC detect success or failure.

It also provided input customized dataword by using getinput function.

## CRC detection simulate Example in main program

    #include "CRClib.h"

    using namespace std;
    typedef long long byte;

    int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
    {
        int add_bit;
        bool status;
        
        byte divisor = 0x123;
        
        byte dataword;
        byte arg_dataword;
        byte remainder;
        byte codeword;

        byte syndrome;
        byte received;
        byte received_dataword;

        //random number with time seed
        srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
        
        //For Sender side
        dataword = getdataword(divisor);
        add_bit = count_bit(dec2bin(divisor)) - 1;
        arg_dataword = enlargedataword(dataword, add_bit);
        remainder = generator(arg_dataword, divisor);
        codeword = getcodeword(dataword, remainder, add_bit);

        //Throught to the Unreliable Channel with 0.5 error rate
        codeword = channel(codeword, 0.5);

        //For Receiver side
        syndrome = checker(codeword, divisor);
        received_dataword = narrowcodeword(codeword, add_bit);
        received = decision(received_dataword, syndrome);

        //Recognize CRC detection success or failure and log it
        status = comparedataword(dataword, received, syndrome);
        logging(status);

        return 0;
    }

## How To build the application

Because this project is the Xcode project, you need...

* Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or late version.
* Intel Mac.
* Xcode.

Just click build button.

## NOTE

The number of bit with augmented dataword only support 19 bits.
